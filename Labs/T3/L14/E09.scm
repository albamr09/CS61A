; Write the function real-most-frequent that accepts a list of key-value pairs where the key is the name of the file, 
; and the values are lines from that file (just like our all-songs example) . Our output is again, a list of single 
; key-value pair. You may want to reuse any functions we have defined so far in the lesson.

; > (real-most-frequent all-songs)
; ((i . 4))


; The solution to this is in "BookProblems/T3/P03_04/E02.scm"
