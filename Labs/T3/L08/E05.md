In the make-withdraw procedure, the local variable balance is created as a parameter of make-withdraw.
We could also create the local state variable explicitly, using let, as follows:

```scheme
(define (make-withdraw initial-amount)
  (let ((balance initial-amount))
    (lambda (amount)
      (if (>= balance amount)
        (begin 
          (set! balance (- balance amount))
          balance
        )
        "Insufficient funds"
      )
    )
  )
)
```

Use the environment model to analyze this alternate version of make-withdraw, drawing figures like the ones above
to illustrate the interactions

```scheme
(define W1 (make-withdraw 100))
(W1 50)
(define W2 (make-withdraw 100))
```

Show that the two versions of make-withdraw create objects with the same behavior. How do the environment 
structures differ for the two versions?

To see on `EnvDraw`, install `STk`, follow the [instructions](/docs/STk.md), even if you have already installed the `.deb` package, because sometimes and for no reason the OS removes the library.

If you have everything installed and ready, head to where you have your `envdraw` executable and run from the terminal:

```bash
$ ./envdraw
STk > (envdraw)
```

Now an extra window appears, where the environment will be drawn while you run declaration in the interpreter, so if you run:

```scheme
STk > (define (make-withdraw initial-amount)
  (let ((balance initial-amount))
    (lambda (amount)
      (if (>= balance amount)
        (begin 
          (set! balance (- balance amount))
          balance
        )
        "Insufficient funds"
      )
    )
  )
)
STk > (define W1 (make-withdraw 100))
STk > (W1 50)
STk > (define W2 (make-withdraw 100))
```

you get the final result.
