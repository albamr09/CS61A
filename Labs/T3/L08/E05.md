In the make-withdraw procedure, the local variable balance is created as a parameter of make-withdraw.
We could also create the local state variable explicitly, using let, as follows:

```scheme
(define (make-withdraw initial-amount)
  (let ((balance initial-amount))
    (lambda (amount)
      (if (>= balance amount)
        (begin 
          (set! balance (- balance amount))
          balance
        )
        "Insufficient funds"
      )
    )
  )
)
```

Use the environment model to analyze this alternate version of make-withdraw, drawing figures like the ones above
to illustrate the interactions

```scheme
(define W1 (make-withdraw 100))
(W1 50)
(define W2 (make-withdraw 100))
```

Show that the two versions of make-withdraw create objects with the same behavior. How do the environment 
structures differ for the two versions?
