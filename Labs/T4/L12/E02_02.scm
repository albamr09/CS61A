; Consider the following interaction, where the id procedure is defined as in E03 and count starts at 0
; Give the responses both when the evaluator memoizes and when it does not.

; (define (square x) (* x x))

;;; L-Eval input:

; (square (id 10))

;;; L-Eval value:

; ⟨response⟩ = 100

;;; L-Eval input:

; count

;;; L-Eval value:

; ⟨response⟩ = 1
