# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

Repository for the labs assignments, and projects for the [Computer Science 61A (CS61A) Course of Berkeley](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E?sort=titleSorter), based on the book [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) that uses Scheme.

## Set up

- Using the [`Scheme Compiler (MIT/GNU)`](./docs/MIT.md)
- Using the [`Racket Compiler`](./docs/RACKET.md)

## Projects

- [Twenty One](./Projects/01/Scheme)
- [Twenty One | GUI](./Projects/01/GUI) (working on it)

## Notes

First of all, at the start of the course the the [`Scheme Compiler (MIT/GNU)`](http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/) was used. So in some sections there are two folders:

- `MIT`: where the programs where made using the `MIT/GNU` compiler.
- `Racket`: where the `Racket` compiler was used.


For the labs, we follow the naming convention given by:

```
./Labs/T{unit_number}/L{lab_number}/E{exercise_number}.scm
```
---

For the `SS` book exercises we follow the convention given by:

```
./SimpleScheme/Ch{chapter_number}/E{exercise_number}.scm
```
---

For problems layed out on the book, the following convention is used:

```
./BProblems/T{unit_number}/P{section_number}_{subsection_number}.scm
```
---

For projects, the following convention is used:

```
./Projects/{unit_number}/
```

And some discarded procedures are in:

```
./Projects/{unit_number}/._mytests
```
